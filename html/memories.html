                In the era of fake people
                I have a brother who treats me like a "Gajubomma".
                you are just like my second father that's why I am calling you as "nanna" you really treat me like a child am very grateful to have you as a brother.. 
                Our bond started from taking picture 📸 and from the message " Hi Anna "☺ to sharing everything and my day is really incomplete without talking to you😕.
